##Tournament format, standings, and tiebreaks

2.1 Format

This will be a Swiss System tournament of [NUMBER] rounds. A match win
will score 1 point; a tie scores a half point; a loss or forfeit scores
0 points.

2.1.1 Pairings
For the first round, matches will be paired according to the judgment of
the tournament director. For subsequent rounds, teams will be paired at
random against other teams with the same score of Won : Lost games.
2.1.2 Under no circumstances will two teams will play each other more
than once.
2.1.3 There will be no eliminations due to poor results or lost
games.

For information on the Swiss System, you can review the following
links:

* Wikipedia,
* World Chess Federation,
* Swiss tournament rules DCI Tournament Handbook

2.1.4 Tiebreakers
Ties will be broken by the following criteria, descending:

1. The result of the head-to-head matchup of the tied participants, if
applicable.
2. The sum of conventional scores of the teams each participant has
beaten, with the greater combined score automatically winning the
tiebreaker. (see [nEUSTADTL SCORE])

Consult a tournament director with any questions about the format.

2.2 Deadlines
Because the pairings for each round are based on prior round scoring,
each round cannot be paired until every match from the previous round is
completed. Therefore, there will be a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for matches
that remain unplayed past the round deadline.

2.2 Maps
2.2.1 [MAP POOL]
2.2.2 The map schedule for each round will be posted with the first
round pairings.
2.2.3 All finales will be played except for The Parish finale.

competitor who drops from a roster may not re-join with another team
after the registration deadline.

Section 4

##Servers

The match servers will be selected according to the following process.

4.1 The server must be dedicated and hosted by a reputable hosting
company inside the continental United States.

4.2 The server will have an up to date and working installation of the
configuration. The version to be played will be posted with the pairings
each round.

to another tickrate.

4.4 Servers with DoS protection are always given priority unless they
are outside the continental United States.

4.5 If both teams have a server but cannot agree on which server to
use, the match will be played on the server with the most even average
ping for all the competitors.

4.6 If no available server can be found after this process has been
exhausted, a Tournament Director must be contacted immediately.

4.7 Matches may be delayed to find a suitable server, but UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER WILL LATE RESULTS BE ACCEPTED. (See Section
2.2)

## Match scheduling and match rules

5.1 Rounds and scheduling
Pairings and brackets for each round will be posted weekly on Monday.
Results must be submitted by the following Sunday at midnight [TIME
ZONE].

5.1.1 Matches must be scheduled by the posted scheduling deadline.
Scheduled match times can be submitted by posting in the tournament
thread only. Teams are encouraged to begin negotiating the schedule
early; irreconcilable conflicts must be brought to the attention of the
staff before the scheduling deadline.

5.1.2 Results must be posted with a screenshot to the thread for the
round on L4DNation. Failure to report weekly round results by the
deadline will result in a double forfeit.

5.1.3 Any player on the roster may perform scheduling duties.

5.1.4 Each team must agree on the server at the time the match is
scheduled. However, the server IP ought not be reported publicly.

5.2 Tardiness
5.2.1 Each team has 15 minutes after the scheduled time to have 4
players in the server and readied up. The standard penalty for failure
will be a forfeit loss of the match.

5.2.2 Each team is permitted one (1) 10-minute break per match, and
only between rounds. Extra breaks require the consent of both the other
team, and the admins or casters.

5.3 Casting
The players agree that the matches may be casted according to the usual
process. Servers should have room for up to two casters, two cameramen,
and an admin. Access to mumble servers for ‘war rooms’ is appreciated
but not required.

5.4 Spectators and admins
5.4.1 Any team may request that an admin be present at their match. The
staff will honor reasonable requests to the best of their ability,
weighing conflicting obligations, the significance of the match to the
tournament results, and the seriousness of concerns about improper
behavior that may take place.

5.4.2 Aside from authorized casters and admins, no spectators
whatsoever will be allowed in the server during matches.

5.5 Ringers
5.5.1 Both teams must agree to allow ringers before the match, or
ringers will not be allowed.

5.5.2 No registered competitor may ring for another team unless their
team has withdrawn or been eliminated from the tournament, regardless
of consent from the other team.

5.6 Pauses
5.6.1 Intentionally affecting the result of the round through excessive
pausing may be brought to the attention of the TD.

5.6.2 The penalty for abuse of the pause function will typically be
whichever is greater between:

- a zero score for the round for the offending team, or
- an adjustment of the score of the offended team equivalent to full
  map distance (with health bonus at the time of the offense).

5.7 Screenshots and demos
5.7.1 Each participant is required to record and save demos of their
match play. All demos must be stored until the end of the tournament,
and must be submitted to a tournament director on request.

5.7.2 Competitors are never required to provide demos to anyone except
the staff.

5.7.3 To record a demo, open the console and type “record <demoname>”.
It is not necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is
necessary to re-record after disconnecting from the server for any
reason.

5.7.4 Each competitor must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone
in the server.

5.7.5 It is each competitor’s individual responsibility to ensure that
demos and screenshots are recorded, uncorrupted, and submitted. Failure
to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the TD will result at
minimum in a zero score for the associated rounds, and possible
suspension of the player from subsequent matches.

5.9 Illegal techniques

5.9.1 It is illegal for an infected player to position himself around a
ladder in a way that blocks an enemy player trying to climb up or down,
intentionally or unintentionally. Penalties for infractions will be
decided on a case by case basis, but will typically consist of a
partial reduction of match score.

5.9.2 It is illegal for either side to hit the “Moustaschio” button on
c2m4. The penalty for infractions will be a zero score for the round,
or a 700 point penalty to overall match score, whichever is greater.

5.10 Glitches

5.10.1 In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on
Swamp Fever, but also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half
will be replayed following a restart round. If necessary the final
scores will be calculated manually.

5.7.2 If a pinned survivor is unclearable after an infected player
gains control of the tank, either team can request that the round be
replayed. If requested, the tournament directors may review demos and
determine if the result of the replayed round will be used, or if some
other action will be taken according to the circumstances.

directors may choose to sanction competitors for any addons or
modifications at their sole and arbitrary discretion (per Section 1.3).

All competitors are urged strongly to discuss any modifications with
the tournament directors to ensure they are fully in compliance with
the rules before making any changes. The best way to avoid the severe
penalties associated with bending or breaking these rules is to play
with a stock configuration.

forfeit loss for the match. There is no maximum penalty, which may run
up and including team expulsion from the tournament, forfeiture of
already played matches, and forfeiture of team eligibility for any
prizes.

6.2.3 Modifying or removing gun models and reload animations
6.2.4 Modifying “tank music” including altering the volume

infected in “ghost mode”
6.2.6 Modifying or removing the red tint while spawned as special
infected or tank
6.2.7 In-game configuration files and scripts that do not exploit
“cheat” cvars, as noted on the official List of cvars, and do not
circumvent cvars blocked by the competitive configuration (e.g.
mat_hdr)
6.2.8 Command-line arguments that do not exploit nor allow the player
to exploit “cheat” cvars
6.2.9 Any configuration setting that can be altered using the standard
in-game menu options or legal console variables

6.3 Forbidden modifications
Aside from the above, no modifications to game files or materials, nor
use of third-party software and applications that affect gameplay will
be allowed, without the public, prior, and written authorization of the
tournament director(s). This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

6.3.1 Any changes whatsoever to the stock survivor or infected models,
map textures, skyboxes, props, or other materials and files used for
rendering the in-game environment
6.3.2 Any changes whatsoever to game sounds (excluding Section 6.2.4)
6.3.3 Any third-party applications, programs, or macros that read or
modify memory in a method for affecting gameplay, or that provide
information about the game state to the player, or that simulate mouse
movement (aiming) while the game is running

6.4 Lerp toggling
After the ready-up for the first half of each map, changing cl_interp
and cl_interp_ratio values is forbidden until both halves of the round
are complete.

6.5 Aside from exceptions provided in Section 6.5.1, enabling or
disabling addons or modifying files after the first ready-up is strictly
forbidden, even when disconnecting or reconnecting from the server.
