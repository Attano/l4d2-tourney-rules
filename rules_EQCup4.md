#####1.2 Disputes
The Tournament directors are the arbiters and court of last resort for
all disputes. Their decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

#####1.3 Sanctions
The Tournament directors reserve the right to impose any sanction on any
team or individual player at their sole discretion as circumstances may
warrant.

#####1.4 Conflicts of interest
Staff may participate in the tournament. Where there may be an

to a counterpart if possible.

#####1.5 Official communication
Official communication will take place via [the official cup group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ne4d).

#####1.6 Changes
The tournament directors reserve the right to make any changes or updates deemed necessary regarding anything to do with the tournament as it is ongoing.

#####1.7 Server bans
The tournament directors do not have the authority to demand server admins rescind player bans on their servers if a banned player is trying to play a match. It is to the server admin's discretion whether the player's ban may be temporarily rescinded.

##Section 2: Tournament format, standings, and tiebreaks

#####2.1 Format
This will be a hybrid tournament featuring both domestic and international play. The opening phase consists of 8 domestic groups, with the top two teams from each group going on to advance into the single-elimination bracket for the concluding knockout phase of the tournament.

######2.1.1 Awarding a bye
In the event of an uneven number of teams in one group, a bye will be awarded at random to each team in the round they are not playing.

#####2.2 Deadlines
All teams must schedule and play their matches within the deadline. 

Unless teams make the effort to communicate with the admins to explain any potential difficulties within reasonable time of the deadline, there will be a *ZERO TOLERANCE* policy for matches that remain unscheduled or unreported past the round deadline.

#####2.3 Maps
- Dead Center
- Dark Carnival
- Swamp Fever
- Hard Rain
- The Parish
- Death Toll
- Dead Air
- Detour Ahead


All listed custom campaigns can be downloaded [here.](http://31.186.250.11/addons/)

######2.3.2 Finales
All finales must be played with no exceptions.

##Section 3: Team registration

#####3.1 Registration
Teams may register by signing up [here.]()

#####3.2 No Team Changing
Once the tournament goes live, participants will not be allowed to switch to another team. You are with your team for the entire duration of their participation.

##Section 4: Servers
Game servers will be selected according to the following criteria:

#####4.1 Hosting
Servers must be chosen where any tournament director is able to connect to spectate matches - servers where any of the tournament directors have zero access will not be permitted.

#####4.2 Configuration
The server will have an up-to-date and working installation of the EQ 3.0c configuration and plugins. Failure to use the correct version of the configuration will render the result of a match null and void.

#####4.3 Web-cast support
Servers will have enough slots for a minimum of one cameraman, one caster, a cup admin and/or
a server admin if one can be present. Support for the spechud addon is highly desirable.

#####4.4 Tickrate
Servers with tickrates ranging from 30-100 are allowed, preferably 100 tick as there is less latency and higher updaterate, making international competition a better experience.

#####4.5 DOS protection
Servers with DoS Protection are preferred.

#####4.6 Continental and international draws

#####4.6.1 Neutral Matches
Domestic matches (EU vs EU, NA vs NA, etc) will be played on their respective home servers. International matches will be played on the most neutral server possible for both teams - the servers that offer the least amount of ping disparity between the two teams.

#####4.6.2 Allocated servers
Note: this table is still subject to change based on any further server testing carried out and does not take into account Rule 4.6.3 below which is reserved for exceptional circumstances. If there are other server locations not listed below which would prove to be ideal for certain match draws, they may also be used (such as Colorado servers for NA teams).

Region | Europe | Russia | North America | South America | Japan | Asia | Oceania  
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---  
Europe | EUROPE | *Europe* | *East Coast* | *East Coast* | *Dallas* | *West Coast* | *West Coast*  
Russia | *Europe* | RUSSIA | *East Coast* | *East Coast* | *Chicago* | *Dallas/West Coast* | *West Coast* 
North America | *East Coast* | *East Coast* | CHICAGO/DALLAS | *East Coast* | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | *West Coast*  
South America | *East Coast* | *East Coast* | *East Coast* | *SA* | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | *West Coast*
Japan | *Dallas* | *Chicago* | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | JAPAN | *Asia* | *West Coast*
Asia | *Dallas* | *Chicago* | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | *Asia* | *Asia* | *West Coast*  
Oceania | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | *West Coast* | *Oceania* 

SERVER = Continental Matches

*Server* = International Matches

####4.6.3 International Consistency
For international draws, it is deemed necessary to field the same players in both home and away matches in order to mitigate ping disparity as much as possible. Server locations may differ based on the range of pings within one/both teams (i.e. a team comprising of at least three West Coast players may use a server closer to home if they are playing a European team) but the exact rosters fielded must remain the same. Substitutions are only allowed in the event of any player being unable to participate in the other match, and will result in a variable points penalty calculated by the discrepancy of the substituting player's latency, should it be lower than that of the original player's.

##Section 5: Match scheduling and match rules

#####5.1 Rounds and scheduling
Pairings for each round will be posted weekly on Monday.

Althought not mandatory, players can use the free online scheduling tool
at [doodle.com](http://doodle.com): it is free, functional, does not
require registration, and supports time zones.

######5.1.1 Scheduling deadline
Teams are encouraged to begin negotiating the schedule early; delinquent
scheduling must be brought to the attention of the staff before the
deadline.

######5.1.2 Reporting deadline
Results must be submitted, with a screenshot, by the following Monday at
midday. Failure to report weekly round results accompanied with a screenshot of the final score for confirmation, will be recorded in a score of 1-0 for the winning team instead of the actual final score.

######5.1.3 Scheduling duties
Any player on the roster may perform scheduling duties.


#####5.2 Casting
The players agree that the matches may be casted according to the usual
process. Access to mumble servers for ‘war rooms’ is appreciated
but not required.

#####5.3 Spectators and admins

######5.3.1 Requests for Oversight
Any team may request that an admin be present at their match. The staff
will honour reasonable requests to the best of their ability, weighing
conflicting obligations, the significance of the match to the tournament
results, and the seriousness of concerns about improper behaviour that
may take place.

######5.3.2 Spectators
Aside from staff and authorised casters, no spectators whatsoever will
be allowed in the server during matches.

#####5.4 Ringers
Ringers are allowed, so long as they are not registered with another competing team. A player who has already been called as a ringer for another team, may only ring if the opposing team is fine with it. The minimum penalty for the violation of this rule will be an official warning to both the ringer and the team captain. The severity of the penalty may increase depending on certain circumstances which will be decided by the admins.

######5.4.1 Double agents
No registered competitor may ring for another team unless their team has
withdrawn from the tournament or they have been removed from the roster.

#####5.5 Pauses

######5.5.1 Excessive pausing
Intentionally affecting the result of the round through excessive
pausing may be brought to the attention of the tournament directors.

The penalty for abuse of the pause function can range from an official warning to a more severe form of punishment.

#####5.6 Screenshots and demos

######5.6.1 Demos are mandatory
Each participant is required to record and save demos of their match
play. All demos must be stored until the end of the tournament, and
must be submitted promptly to a tournament director on request.

######5.6.2 How-to record demos
To record a demo, open the console and type `record <demoname>`.  It is
not necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to
re-record after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

######5.6.3 Screenshots are mandatory
Each team is allowed up to one (1) pause per round to request
screenshots.

Each competitor must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone in the
server.

######5.6.4 Demo investigations
Tournament administrators have the authority to request and investigate any demos
believed to contain footage of suspicious activity from any participant. Casters
and participants may request demos from another participant for the same reason,
as long as the casters and participants were in the same match that the supposed
moment(s) occured.

In the interests of good faith and vigilance, it is mandatory for the approached 
participant(s) to comply with this request. But no participant is obliged to hand over 
their demos to viewers or participants with no involvement in the specified match.

######5.6.5 Responsibility is with you
It is each competitor’s individual responsibility to ensure that demos
and screenshots are recorded, uncorrupted, and submitted when requested.

Failure to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the staff will
result in a form of punishment that will be decided at the admins' discretion.

#####5.7 Illegal techniques

######5.7.1 AI pathing exploits
It is illegal to intentionally exploit AI pathing by moving to an area
that causes NPC infected to stop attacking. This includes re-entering the
safe-room and standing behind a dynamic prop that the witch cannot
navigate around. However, is permitted to exploit witch pathing in a way
that causes her to climb over objects repeatedly.

The minimum penalty for intentionally exploiting AI pathing will be 500 points deducted.

######5.7.2 Tank parking
If an AI tank stops advancing for any reason, the survivors must be
notified in a reasonable time. Intentionally positioning a tank so that
it cannot advance when AI-controlled is not allowed.

The minimum penalty for intentional tank parking will be an official warning for the one responsible. The maximum penalty will be decided by the tournament directors if deemed necessary.

######5.7.3 Spectating
Players may spectate if and only if they have unintentionally become
stuck in a clip brush or other entity and cannot move.

The minimum penalty for abuse of the spectate command will be an official warning for the one responsible. The maximum penalty will be decided by the tournament directors if deemed necessary.

#####5.8 Glitches

######5.8.1 Rescue vehicles
In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on Swamp
Fever, but also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half will
be replayed following a restart round. If necessary the final scores
will be calculated manually.

######5.8.2 Unclearable survivors
If a pinned survivor is unclearable after an infected player gains
control of the tank, either team can request that the round be
replayed. If requested, the tournament directors may review demos and
determine if the result of the replayed round will be used, or if some
other action will be taken according to the circumstances.

######5.8.3 Common-hopping
The round will not be restarted if a survivor dies, gets incapped or sustains fall damage as a result of bouncing off of the heads of common infected. It's a known issue, so just be vigilant around them.

######5.8.4 Unequal Tank Spawns
If a tank is due to spawn in an area known to be unequal in the exact moment the tank is triggered, both teams are allowed to restart the chapter but must request to do so before starting the first round of that chapter.

##Section 6: Addons and configuration
The following guidelines will assist the competitors in understanding
the intentions of the league directors. However, the league
directors may choose to sanction competitors for any addons or
modifications at their sole and arbitrary discretion (per Section 1.3).

All competitors are urged strongly to discuss any modifications with
the league directors to ensure they are fully in compliance with
the rules before making any changes. The best way to avoid the severe
penalties associated with bending or breaking these rules is to play
with a stock configuration.

loss for the match. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team
expulsion from the league and forfeiture of already played matches.

#####6.2 Permitted modifications
The following modifications are PERMITTED:

Modifying or removing the red tint that appears while spawned as special
infected or tank is allowed.

######6.2.7 Console variables ("cvars")
Source engine configuration files and scripts that do not exploit
“cheat” cvars, as noted on the official List of cvars, and do not
circumvent cvars blocked by the competitive configuration (e.g.
`mat_hdr`) are allowed.

######6.2.8 Command-line arguments
All command-line arguments that do not exploit nor allow the player to
exploit “cheat” cvars are allowed.

######6.2.9 GUI options
Any configuration setting that can be altered using the standard
in-game menu options or legal console variables is allowed.

#####6.3 Forbidden modifications
Aside from the above, no modifications to game files or materials, nor

be allowed, without the public, prior, and written authorization of the
tournament director(s). This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

######6.3.1 Visual elements
Any changes whatsoever to the stock survivor or infected models, map
textures, skyboxes, props, or other materials and files used for
rendering the in-game environment are forbidden.

######6.3.2 Audio elements
Any changes whatsoever to game sounds (excluding Sections 6.2.4-5) are
forbidden.

######6.3.3 Third-party hooks

about the game state to the player, or that simulate mouse movement
(aiming) while the game is running are forbidden.

######6.3.4 Wait commands
Any use of the wait commands is forbidden.

#####6.4 Lerp toggling
After the ready-up for the first half of the first map, changing `cl_interp`
and `cl_interp_ratio` values is forbidden for the remainder of the match. It is only permissable to toggle the values for any player when they have to reconnect to the server and reset the values to how they were before the first map went live. 

#####6.5 Addon toggling
Aside from exceptions provided in Section 6.2.1, enabling or disabling
addons or modifying files after the first ready-up is strictly
forbidden, even when disconnecting or reconnecting from the server.

#####6.6 Cheating

Any act of cheating (which includes any form of aim assistance, wallhacking, mathacking, speedhacking and more) will result in the offending individual player being banned from the remainder of the tournament regardless of whether it occurred during an official match or outside of it. If more than one player from the same team has been caught cheating during the duration of the tournament, then the entire team will be disqualified from the tournament. Any loopholes that are exercised due to potential lack of clarification in the rules and which the admins deem to be a violation of this rule, will be discussed and decided upon to the discretion of the tournament directors, while reserving the right to hand out similar penalties.

#####6.7 POV Status
Any player who is marked with POV status by the admins, is mandatorily required to stream all of the tournament matches they compete in, with lagless synchronisation and a virtual on-screen keyboard. Failure to comply with this rule will result in the POV player serving a one-match ban and the team receiving a penalty of 1,000 points. If the same POV player breaches the rule a second time, they will be barred from competing any further in the tournament.

objects, such as: weapons, other players, infected models, props, or any
other recognizable game element.
