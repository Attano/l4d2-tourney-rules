#####1.2 Disputes
The Tournament Director is the sole arbiter and court of last resort for
all disputes. His decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

#####1.3 Sanctions
The tournament directors reserve the right to impose any sanction on any
team or individual player at their sole discretion as circumstances may
warrant.

#####1.4 Conflicts of interest

##Section 2: Tournament format, standings, and tiebreaks

#####2.1 Format
This will be a basic Single Elimination tourney with no group stages.

######2.1.1 Pairings
After the registration deadline, the registered participants will be
seeded randomly(this is an M2 cup after all).

#####2.2 Deadlines
Because the pairings based on prior round scoring, the next round
cannot be paired until all the results of the previous round have been
reported.

Therefore, there will be a *ZERO TOLERANCE* policy for matches that
remain unreported past the round deadline.

#####2.3 Maps
- **1/8:** Swamp Fever
- **1/4:** Hard Rain
- **1/2:** The Parish
- **FINAL:** Dark Carnival

#####3.2 Registration deadline
The deadline for registrations is midnight on [DATE]. Late registrations
will not be accepted.

#####3.3 Double registration
Competitors may be registered for only one team in the tournament. A
competitor who drops from a roster may not re-join with another team
after the registration deadline.

##Section 4: Config & Servers
The config used in this tourney is **JaegerMod**, which is featured 
exclusively on **Hyper-V** servers. This is where the rule of **Hyper-V** being 
the only allowed servers stems from.

##Section 5: Match scheduling and match rules

#####5.1 Rounds and scheduling
Pairings and brackets for each round will be updated via **BinaryBeast**.

Players are strongly encouraged to use the free online scheduling tool
at [whenisgood.net](http://whenisgood.net): it is free, functional, does
not require registration, and supports time zones.

######5.1.1 Scheduling deadline
Teams are encouraged to begin negotiating the schedule early; delinquent
scheduling must be brought to the attention of the staff before the
deadline.

######5.1.2 Reporting deadline
Results must be submitted, with a screenshot, by the following Sunday at
midnight. Failure to report weekly round results before the deadline
will result in a randomly awarded defwin. Under no circumstances whatsoever will
extensions be granted.

######5.1.3 Scheduling duties
Any player on the roster may perform scheduling duties.

#####5.2 Tardiness
Each team has 15 minutes after the scheduled time to have 4 players in
the server and readied up. The standard penalty for failure will be a
forfeit loss of the match.

Each team is permitted one (1) 10-minute break per match, and only
between rounds. Extra breaks require the consent of both the other
team, and the admins or casters.

#####5.3 Casting
The players agree that the matches may be casted according to the usual
process. Access to mumble servers for ‘war rooms’ is appreciated
but not required.

#####5.4 Spectators and admins

######5.4.1 Requests for Oversight
Any team may request that an admin or an admin-approved party be present at their match. The staff
will honor reasonable requests to the best of their ability, weighing
conflicting obligations, the significance of the match to the tournament
results, and the seriousness of concerns about improper behavior that
may take place.

######5.4.2 Spectators
Aside from staff and authorized casters, no spectators whatsoever will
be allowed in the server during matches.

#####5.5 Ringers
Both teams must agree to allow ringers before the match, or ringers will
not be allowed.

######5.5.1 Double agents
No registered competitor may ring for another team unless their team has
withdrawn from the tournament or they have been removed from the roster.

#####5.6 Pauses

######5.6.1 Excessive pausing
Intentionally affecting the result of the round through excessive
pausing may be brought to the attention of the TD.

The penalty for abuse of the pause function will typically be whichever
is greater between:

- a zero score for the round for the offending team, or
- an adjustment of the score of the offended team equivalent to full
  map distance (with health bonus at the time of the offense).

#####5.7 Screenshots and demos

######5.7.1 Demos are mandatory
Each participant is required to record and save demos of their match
play. All demos must be stored until the end of the tournament, and
must be submitted promptly to a tournament director on request.

######5.7.2 How-to record demos
To record a demo, open the console and type `record <demoname>`.  It is
not necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to
re-record after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

######5.7.3 Screenshots are mandatory
Each team is allowed up to one (1) pause per round to request
screenshots from each player of the opponent team.

Each competitor must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone in the
server.

######5.7.4 Privacy
Competitors are required to provide demos or screenshots to the staff and their 
respective opponent for the given match. Although there is no basis for an expectation of
privacy, they are considered confidential and will be shared only for:

- Asking second opinions of skilled players who are trusted to keep what
  they find in confidence
- To expose wrongdoing to the community if, and only if, it is discovered

######5.7.5 Responsibility is with you
It is each competitor’s individual responsibility to ensure that demos
and screenshots are recorded, uncorrupted, and submitted in a timely
manner.

Failure to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the staff or the opponent will
result at minimum in a zero score for the associated rounds, and
possible suspension of the player from the tournament.

#####5.9 Illegal techniques

######5.9.1 Ladder blocking
It is illegal for any player to position themselves around a ladder in a
way that blocks an enemy player trying to climb up or down, whether
intentionally or unintentionally. Penalties for infractions will be
decided on a case by case basis, but will typically consist of a partial
reduction of match score.

######5.9.2 Moustachio
It is illegal for either side to hit the “Moustachio” button on c2m4.
The penalty for infractions will be whichever is greater between a zero
score for the round, or a penalty equivalent to the full distance with
health bonus for the survivor team at the time the button was hit.

######5.9.3 Tank parking
If an AI tank stops advancing for any reason, the survivors must be
notified in a reasonable time.

Intentionally positioning a tank so that it cannot advance when AI
controlled is not allowed.

######5.9.4 Spectating
Players may not spectate during a live game, regardless of circumstances. The **!stuck** feature must be used to unstick yourself. If it doesn't help, the player must rejoin the server ***without prior spectating***.

The minimum penalty for a one-time use of the spectate command will be 100 pts. 
The maximum penalty for abused, repeated or severe
infractions will be a forfeit loss of the match.

#####5.10 Glitches

######5.10.1 Unclearable survivors
If a pinned survivor is unclearable after an infected player gains
control of the tank, either team can request that the round be
replayed. If requested, the tournament directors may review demos and
determine if the result of the replayed round will be used, or if some
other action will be taken according to the circumstances.

##Section 6: Addons and configuration
The following guidelines will assist the competitors in understanding
the intentions of the tournament directors. However, the tournament
directors may choose to sanction competitors for any addons or
modifications at their sole and arbitrary discretion (per Section 1.3).

All competitors are urged strongly to discuss any modifications with
the tournament directors to ensure they are fully in compliance with
the rules before making any changes. The best way to avoid the severe
penalties associated with bending or breaking these rules is to play
with a stock configuration.

#####6.1 Penalties
The minimum penalty for illegal modifications or addons is a forfeit
loss for the match. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team
expulsion from the tournament, forfeiture of already played matches, and
forfeiture of team eligibility for any prizes.

#####6.2 Permitted modifications
The following modifications are PERMITTED:

######6.2.1 Blue tint
Modifying or removing the blue tint while spawning special infected in
“ghost mode” is allowed.

######6.2.2 Red tint
Modifying or removing the red tint that appears while spawned as special
infected or tank is allowed.

######6.2.3 Console variables ("cvars")
Source engine configuration files and scripts that do not exploit
“cheat” cvars, as noted on the official List of cvars, and do not
circumvent cvars blocked by the competitive configuration (e.g.
`mat_hdr`) are allowed.

######6.2.4 Command-line arguments
All command-line arguments that do not exploit nor allow the player to
exploit “cheat” cvars are allowed.

######6.2.5 GUI options
Any configuration setting that can be altered using the standard
in-game menu options or legal console variables is allowed.

#####6.3 Forbidden modifications
Aside from the above, no modifications to game files or materials, nor
use of third-party software and applications that affect gameplay will
be allowed, without the public, prior, and written authorization of the
tournament director(s). This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

######6.3.1 Visual elements
Any changes whatsoever to the stock survivor or infected models, map
textures, skyboxes, props, or other materials and files used for
rendering the in-game environment are forbidden.

######6.3.2 Audio elements
Any changes whatsoever to game sounds are forbidden.

######6.3.3 Third-party hooks
Any third-party applications, programs, or macros that read or modify
memory in a method for affecting gameplay, or that provide information
about the game state to the player, or that simulate mouse movement
(aiming) while the game is running are forbidden.

#####6.4 Lerp toggling
After the ready-up for the first half of each map, changing `cl_interp`
and `cl_interp_ratio` values is forbidden until both halves of the round
are complete.

##Section 7: Behavior and etiquette

#####7.1 Conduct
Players are expected to conduct themselves politely and professionally
during the match. Abusive or harassing conduct toward other players,
spectators, or tournament administrators will not be tolerated.

#####7.2 Sound effects
Players may not use console commands or radial menus to trigger
sound-effects that taunt, harass, annoy, or confuse other players. This
includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

* Survivor laughter or coughing vocalizations
* User-controlled special infected vocalizations of any kind whatsoever
* Survivor death sounds, or other vocalizations associated with player
  state or health (such as incapacitation or being “black and white”)
* Triggered vocalizations or sound effects associated with director
  events (such as the rescue vehicle’s arrival, etc)

#####7.3 Sprays
Players may not use sprays that imitate or resemble environmental
objects, such as weapons, other players, infected models, props, or any
other recognizable game element.

Players may not use sprays that are grotesque, violent, obscene, or
depict other disturbing or offensive imagery such as pornography,
racist logos, or “shock” images.
